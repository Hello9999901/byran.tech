title: 'Adafruit Lithium Ion Polymer (Li-Po) Battery List'
description: 'Please read :) Hi! I couldn't find a Adafruit Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) battery size/capacity/connector/weight list anywhere on the interwebs, so I decided to compile my own! Adafruit's batteries use a JST-PH 2 Pin (and this) connector and have a max voltage of 4.2 when fully charged (from the website).'

## Hi!

This (unofficial) Adafruit [Lithium Polymer Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_battery) comparison chart and size list has every single Li-po battery as of the current date of August 24, 2021 (08/24/2021), excluding the battery *packs* . Those are cylindrical, so I didn't think it would fit in this list.

Note: It is important to keep in mind that the size/height are different in the website and the datasheet (located in the details section in the product pages). Also, clicking on the pictures lead to the product page. I took mine from the product pages. Also (quite a few notes I guess), the sorting might not work too well. Lastly, the table is using [Datatables](https://datatables.net) (MIT) if you were wondering.
