OK, I'm sure that almost every techy person already knows about Apple Silicon. Yes, goodbye Intel, hello in-house SoCs.

Why does this really matter? First of all, Apple's been making their own chips for a really long time. They almost always perform top of class in the mobile industry. Think about it: the iPad Pro 2019-20 can run Fortnite at 120FPS, more than many computers are capable of. I'm not kidding when I say that they are FAST. They are also very cool and easy to cool, possible making Apple's amazingly thin laptops even thinner (I think that there's a point in which a laptop cannot get any thinner or else it would just feel flimsy). However, I think that it's great. With ARM chips, they can get AMAZINGLY high battery life.

What are ARM chips? It is a computer architecture (like x86). However, UNLIKE x86, which uses CISC (complex instruction set computer), it uses RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which makes them very power efficient whilst maintaining that snappy feel. Apple LOVES optimization, so they might even be able to get away with minimal parts whilst giving you that high-end feel. Think about it, iPhones are sometimes even faster than phones that have 10+ GB of RAM. iPhones only have around 3GB.

Needless to be said, I think that Intel is gonna get shaken up, the fact that one of their big buyers are gone (Apple will still keep rolling out Intel products as well for the time being). This is, I believe, a bigger trend for the integration (not merging) of iPadOS, iOS and macOS. It's truly a revolutionizing time in the tech industry.
