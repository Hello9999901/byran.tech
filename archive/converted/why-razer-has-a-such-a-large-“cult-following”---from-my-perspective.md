If you are a gamer, I'm sure you've heard of Razer. If you haven't here's some background knowledge that may or may not be helpful. Razer (spelled with an “e” not “o”) is a gaming hardware company that makes quite famous gaming gear, such as their Razer Blade laptop series and Razer mice and keyboard. They are huge. In 2014 (a long time ago), they already took up 31% of the gaming mice industry.

Ok, so why do they have a “Cult Following”? Well, in terms of Razer's marketing, “cult” has a fully positive connotation. It's like the Apple of gaming. Many people buy Razer gear just for the brand. There's tens of thousands of people in the reddit group “Cult of Razer”. Why is that?

Well, I will first attempt to answer from my perspective. I am a mobile gamer, so I don't really have “hands-on” experience with too many Razer products. When it comes to gaming gear for PC, I go with Logitech G. Logitech is known for its reliability and “just-workability”. I have Logitech G keyboard and mice. However, I do have a Razer Blade Stealth Late-2019, and WOW! - I can tell you straight away that it is the Apple of gaming. Yes, there's tons of things I dislike about it, but the build quality and the general “power” of it is AMAZING. And that “power” is why Razer can acquire such a large following.

They lead the industry on many fronts. Like Apple, they have quite a large R&D budget. Also, they are the go-to brand for gaming. There's just no other brand in this area. If you want good gaming gear, go buy Razer. The hardware and software are industry-leading.

Here's what they have to say about it on [investor.razer.com](https://investor.razer.com) : “Razer™ is the world's leading lifestyle brand for gamers. The triple-headed snake trademark of Razer is one of the most recognized logos in the global gaming and e-sports communities. With a fan base that spans every continent, the company has designed and built the world's largest gamer-focused ecosystem of hardware, software and services. Razer's award-winning hardware includes high-performance gaming peripherals and Blade gaming laptops. Razer's software platform, with over 80 million users, includes Razer Synapse (an Internet of Things platform), Razer Chroma (a proprietary RGB lighting technology system), and Razer Cortex (a game optimizer and launcher).”

Yes. Like Apple, it has turned into a life-style that people live and breath. It's the fact that they make EVERYTHING gaming to a reliable degree, and with that, people build setups. With setups, people like them to have unison (i.e. one brand, on color scheme). With Razer's amazing good RGB and the fact that they cover EVERYTHING gaming, there's just no way to compete. They are simply the top-dog of the high-end gaming industry.
