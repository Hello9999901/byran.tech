Customizing Visual Studio Code is part of it's culture and blood. There are hundreds, if not thousands of extensions and themes available to make Visual Studio Code truly yours.

## Super Cool

**better-comments** Better Comments is an extension that makes beautiful (and therefore better) comments. The extension highlights types of comments, such as:

- Alerts

- Queries

- TODOs

- Highlights

- More types can be specified in settings

**beautify** Beautify might be the most useful extension for web development. It can automatically format JS, JSON, CSS, SASS, and HTML. By simply assigning the extension to a keyboard shortcut, it can instantly make any web dev file look better.

**LiveServer** LiveServer quote (from README.md): **"Launch a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages."** Simply put, it hosts a website on your own computer, (usually to port 5500). Every time you change something, it will automatically refresh the page! It is super useful and super simple to use.

**bracket-pair-colorizer-2** I think the name is pretty self-explanatory here; it highlights matching brackets, to make matching different bracket pairs a breeze.

**comment-anchors** Some features overlap with the better-comments extension, but Comment Anchors has a trick up its sleeve. You can set anchors in the comments, as markings to refer to later. On the sidebar, an anchor section will appear, with every "ANCHOR" you set appearing. You can jump to any of the anchors simply by pressing it.

**subtle-brackets** To enhance your bracket matching super-vision, you can use Subtle Match Brackets. This will *subtly* match your brackets by underlining them.

**code-spell-checker** With almost any type of standard casing (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, kebab-case) it will check the spelling of the text, comparing it against a dictionary. With many different languages, it will save you much time finding spelling errors in HTML, JS and CSS!

**better-align** Better Align allows variables (and code in general) to be aligned with a keyboard shortcut. CSS variables, rejoice! No more are the days of having misaligned variables. All variables will be perfectly aligned, easy to read on one line.

**markdown-all-in-one** Markdown All in One is too much to fit into a measly paragraph; with loads of keyboard shortcuts for bold, italic, bullets and more, TOC generation, auto preview, math and more, it is truly all you need for Markdown in Visual Studio Code. In my opinion, the preview feature is the most useful, as you can view processed Markdown on another window, so you know exactly how the Markdown will turn out.

## Working with Git + Github

**gitlens** GitLens allows Git features to be augmented. You can view blames, code authorship, and seamlessly see everything about your Git repositories. The magic of GitLens is only seen when you try it out.

**vscode-pull-request-github** This is a great way to work with GitHub. Normally, PRs and Issues are hard to manage with vanilla Visual Studio Code. Now, it is a piece of cake!

## Working with CSS

**color-highlight** This extension highlights colors in your CSS (and more)! It is super useful to see all the colors in a glance. It even works with color variables.

**classnametocss** This extension automatically syncs class names in CSS, so you always have your classes within autocomplete'sll reach.

## Working with HTML

**path-intellisense** Path Intellisense is a powerful auto-complete for Visual Studio Code. It is better than the included one, as this one has lots of ways to customize, and has support for srcset .

**auto-rename-tag** Need to rename a tag, but hate changing both? Auto Rename Tag has got you covered. By changing one tag, the other one automatically matches!

**vscode-gutter-preview (Image preview)** This extension previews a plethora of image types in the gutter (between the sidebar and code line numbers). The extension scans your code for image paths, and displays a small version right there on the gutter. This way, you can view your images right alongside your code.

**rainbow-tags** This extensions artfully colorizes your code, to make tags and brackets easier to read and associate!

## Working with JS

**npm-intellisense** If you work with NPM (node package manager), then this is a must-have. When you need a package, NPM intellisense automatically completes import boilerplate code.

**vscode-language-babel** Quite simple; parses and highlights Babel JS.

**es6-string-html** When you are writing React CSS in JSX, you will see that the syntax is not highlighted, as the syntax processor thinks it's all just a long string. This extension solves this by highlighting all sorts of code inside ES6 strings.

**vscodeintellicode** TL;DR: AI Autocomplete by Microsoft.

**JavaScriptSnippets** No doubt that JS has lots of boilerplate. Nobody likes typing it all out. This extension solves this existential problem.

## HTML + CSS

**vscode-css-peek** Using this extension, you can see what styling each HTML class and id corresponds to, simply by hovering over it.

**vscode-html-css** Big web page with lots of selectors and lots of naming schemes? This extension helps with CSS class/id autocomplete, saving you more time for actual design and debugging.

## Honorable Mentions

These are amazing extensions for many uses; check them out, you won't regret it! Perhaps you don't need them now, but installing them might just save you later on. xml vscode-xml php-intellisense trailing-spaces

**polacode** In a sea of coding tutorials of the interwebs, how you present your code is vital. Polacode generates beautiful code images inside Visual Studio Code. The only downside is that there is, as far as I know, no line numbering.

**lorem-ipsum** Super simple Lorem Ipsum generator. Lorem ipsum dolor?

**vscode-quick-select** Most times, double clicking will select things within a paragraph, line, quotes, or brackets. However, sometimes you want more granular control of what Visual Studio Code selects. This extensions does exactly that.

## Themes

These themes are my favorite for web development and just coding in general. Personally, I use Dracula Soft (included with Dracula) with a few custom edits. nord-visual-studio-code vscode-theme-onedark nord-wave theme-dracula theme-cobalt2 github-vscode-theme

## Product Icon Themes

Product icons themes are newly released themes that allow for users to customize icons in their Visual Studio Code environment. fluent-icons

## Icon Themes

Lastly, icon themes. I use Material Icon themes with a blue folder color (changeable in settings), but feel free to explore. vscode-icons material-icon-theme
