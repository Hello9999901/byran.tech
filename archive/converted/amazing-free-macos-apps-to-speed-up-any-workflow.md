Well designed and polished apps are essential for any (and every) workflow. Here is a ever growing list of apps that will exponentially speed up workflows. All the apps have been tested by me (to various degrees). Enjoy! **NOTE: ALL OF THE APPS ARE FREE, WITH SOME OF THEM BEING F.O.S.S. (FREE AND OPEN SOURCE)** The open source apps are specified and the specific license (if possible) will be noted Also, the position a given application is on the list is *nominal and does not connote any extra usefulness;* the positions the apps are on the list are completely random.

**1. Rectangle**

Rectangle is a beautiful, polished and simple application with a simple purpose: it makes window sizing a LOT easier. It is similar to Windows's snapping feature, where dragging a window to the corner and letting go of the cursor will automagically (intentional misspelling) resize to the gray highlight that will appear. With Rectangle, you can easily have a very clean and organized desktop with a few simple drags. Free: YES Open Source: YES (MIT License)
