<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Benefits_to_Gaming_Gear_2"></a>Benefits to Gaming Gear</h2>
<h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Why would one want gaming gear? Well, there are many benefits to gaming gear other than gaming, which is probably what most people buy them for. First of all, they are much more comfortable than normal tech.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Just compare a your office mouse to a well kitted out gaming mouse. To this argument you might pose the following answer: “Well, an ergonomic mouse would do just fine.” To answer that, I would like to go on a tangent. First, gaming mice are probably the most responsive mice you’ll ever try. They also have the best sensors. These two are things that are almost oblivious to ergonomic mice or “office mice”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">I’ll pose another example: say you are buying a keyboard. Buy an office keyboard or a better keyboard? Oh, you just heard your friend say that he just bought a mechanical keyboard and it’s the BEST keyboard he’s ever tried? Well, say no more. For $40, you can get your hands on a very comparable mechanical keyboard. You try it, and it’s not as amazing as your friend said. Then, you try your laptop’s keyboard and you realize that it’s not just the longer travel, it’s the FEEL of the keyboard. There’s no turning back. I know I’m groundlessly saying this, but it’s really worth the more cash. What’s the biggest market for mechanical keyboard? Gaming and programming. Who uses and advocates for mechanical keyboards the most? Gamers. So, who sells them? Gaming gear brands. That basically forces you to buy mechanical keyboards from gaming brands. That doesn’t mean it’s gonna have sharp edges and the absolutely brightest RGB in the world. Buying from a reputable gaming brand can result in a keyboard that you can trust on for years to come.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">There are so many things that many people have never tried but gamers use on a regular basis, such as high refresh rate, high resolution mouse sensors and mechanical keyboards. I’ve covered the last 2 already. High refresh rate is something that not many people have tried. Almost all high refresh rate monitors are branded as gaming. I have not tried one, but it sounds promising from literally every single tech enthusiast.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Lastly, and perhaps the thing I value most, is the SOFTWARE. Yes, it might be buggy, yes, it might be low-res. Yes, it may take up resources and RAM that can be used otherwise. However, it’s the ability to do WHATEVER you want with ALL THE EXTRA BUTTONS on the mice and keyboards. Without the software, your gaming mouse is basically just a glorified office mouse. The software is KEY to me. I use it 24/7. Logitech G Hub is very good considering the fact that Logitech doesn’t usually make software. It’s not as feature packed as many others, such as Razer Synapse, but it’s the ability to customize the 11 customizable buttons I have on my mouse. They are so useful if you installed the software, yet so useless if you didn’t. I use macros on my mouse for switching between desktops and tabs, mission control, DPI switching and many more.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Gaming gear is much more than just the RGB and the hype. It’s actually worthwhile if you don’t go for bad/sketchy brands at lower prices.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">P.S. Yes it’s expensive, but it probably will outlast your office mouse.</p>

<!--BLOG #2: WHY ARE MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS SO SOUGHT AFTER?-->
<div>
    <h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1><a id="Sunday_June_21_2020_0"></a>Sunday, June 21, 2020</h5>
    <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Why_are_mechanical_keyboards_so_sought_after_2"></a>Why are mechanical keyboards so sought after?</h2>
    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Why are they so sought after? First, we must turn to what a mechanical keyboard is. I am not talking about what they are, their technical specifications or their advertising. I would like to recognize what the redeeming qualities of mechanical keyboards really are. I am typing on a Logitech G610 Orion Blue, which has Cherry MX Blue switches. This is important, as switches make quite the difference in the typing experience. The polar opposite of mechanical switches are membrane switches. They are the ones found in your average office keyboard that costs the grand total of 10 bucks. Never mind, they are fine and one can type on them. That is because they have never tired a mechanical keyboard. Once you’ve tried one, you will never forget that there’s a whole other world, a community of enthusiasts, making and experimenting with mechanical keyboards. I personally only have experience with Blue switches, meaning that they are “clicky”. That also means they are loud. The travel is long compared to a membrane keyboard, and much more comfortable. It is really amazing. When you press down on the keycaps, you can feel the actuation point, the point in which the key registers to the computer. You know exactly where and how to press the key so that the timing is perfect. This is tremendously important to gaming, as each keypress can mean the difference between life and death in-game. Now, you might think: I know when my key registers to my computer in a membrane keyboard! Well, not really. For Blue switches, there’s around a millimeter of travel from the key moving to the key actuating. I don’t know why, but it just feels so much better.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Mechanical keyboards are good, but they are not cheap. A good, full-size mechanical keyboard from a trustworthy manufacture would set you back around 70-100+ dollars. However, I believe that it is worth it. These keyboards feel much better and would last longer than your 10 dollar keyboard. People correlate mechanical keyboards to “gaming keyboards”, but that really isn’t accurate. “Gaming” things can be important, but they are generally a way for the companies to charge more on a product. My keyboard is marketed as “gaming”, but I almost never use it for gaming, and it works just fine. “Gaming” keyboards can be good, however. For example, most gaming keyboards have software that come with it, allowing for macros and key binds to be put in place. I have also seen SteelSeries keyboards have variable actuation points. These are all good things about gaming keyboards. I don’t really have anything bad to say about gaming keyboards other than the issue that manufacturers overuse the term in marketing. Yes, almost all “GAMING” keyboards are mechanical, but some are cheap and are marketed as “mechanical feel”. They are cheap, but they aren’t mechanical. They are just more stable mechanical switches with more travel. I’ll end it here. There you have it, not really all that complicated. If you want to know which keyboard switch is right for you, search it up on google and take a small switch quiz to find which is right for you.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">P.S. Cherry MX is the gold standard for switches. Buy those if you can (Unless you know your key switches really well).</p>

    <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Gaming_Laptops_2"></a>Gaming Laptops</h2>
    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Gaming laptops. Such great hardware, so portable, right? Well, not really. There’s not much difference between a “gaming laptop” and a “normal laptop”. I have a gaming laptop, but it’s an actually just an ultrabook with a GTX 1650 Max-Q. The Razer Blade Stealth is a great computer, lightweight and compact coming in at just about the size of a MacBook Pro 13 inch, and a bit heavier. The build is amazing. There is no body flex or deck flex. The body is made out of anodized aluminum. Other than the fact the it’s a fingerprint magnet, it’s great. However, this is because Razer actually has the ability to manufacture such a product. Many companies advertise their “gaming laptops” as super fast and best graphics in the world. Yes. It is true. However, they never tell you about the dark side of getting a “gaming laptop”. Sure, it runs Fortnite at 120 FPS on high settings. But it weights heavier than a block of lead. Not to mention how thick the computer gets. My Razer Blade, you might say, is just around the same as a MacBook Pro 13 inch. That’s because it has only an i7-1065G7 and a GTX 1650 Max-Q. I can get around 8 hours of light use. But that’s because the CPU and GPU are low power consumption mobile parts. There isn’t a whole RTX 2080 Ti and a AMD Threadripper in there. It runs Fortnite at 90 FPS on medium. That is the tradeoff between portability and performance. It is necessary (hopefully Apple Silicon can break that chain) for the manufacturer to choose whether to prioritize performance or portability.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Honestly, don’t go for “gaming laptops” just because they are marketed as gaming. Look into CPU specs and GPU specs. Learn lots about laptops and desktops. I did not choose my Razer Blade because it is a “gaming laptop” from a “gaming company” (I did choose it because, you know, Razer). I chose it for its portability to performance ratio and its reputation for high build quality. I could have chosen a 15’’ Blade, but I never really liked 15’’ computers. If you want high performance, go for 17’’+. If you want portability, go for 13’’ or less. I’m not saying that 15’’ laptops are horrid by any means. I just feel that it is like the middle seat on an airplane (however you want to take that statement).</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">So, what do you do if you DON’T want a “gaming laptop”? Well, if you don’t care about the marketing, there’s whole galaxies of selections to choose from. For example, a Dell XPS 13 with an eGPU would do great. You get the battery life when you need it, and get the performance (extra oomph) when you need that. Cool, right? Yeah. I thought so. I have never had an eGPU, or build a PC (I have built my own phone). This is all views from tech YouTubers like LTT, MKBHD and Austin Evans. Like with every mature market (quote MKBHD), there’s a “go to” product. For eGPUS, that would the Razer’s offerings. They are priced well and is very compact/compatible.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">I have talked a lot about the bad sides of getting a “gaming computer”, but let’s talk about the good side. Most gaming laptops have TONS of robust cooling to keep the laptop from thermal throttling. Manufacturers also throw in the best parts they can find with expensive systems. A couple even have full on RTX 2080s. These result in best-in-class performance. An example of this would the the ROG Zephyrus G14. Ryzen 9 4000 series means probably the best performance ever in a laptop in general. In LTT’s video, it even out ran the ludicrously large Acer Predator with an Intel i9 chip.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">In conclusion, gaming laptops, like everything else in tech, is worth it if you know your parts and you know what you are looking for.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">P.S. Please don’t game with a MacBook. Please.</p>

<!--BLOG #4: MY THOUGHTS ON MACOS BIG SUR, IOS 14 AND APPLE SILICON-->
<div>
    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Wednesday, June 24, 2020</h5>
    <h2 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">My Thoughts on macOS Big Sur, iOS 14 and Apple Silicon</h2>
    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">macOS Big Sur, iOS 14, Apple Silicon. To me, I would say that Apple Silicon was the biggest announcement of WWDC 2020. It was a huge leap for apple to finally move on from Intel chips. Many people don’t realize it, but Intel makes some of the worst chips for MacBooks. Yes, they make real fast chips with amazing single-threaded performance, but the chips Apple chooses are simply illogical. My 2017 MacBook has a dual-core (yes, 2 cores) i5. To Intel’s credit though, it does stay cool (kinda) and is still quite useable to this day (or is that Apple’s credit?) I am really looking forward to the new Apple Silicon-based laptops and hopefully desktops. If Apple’s WWDC is to be believed, their chips will run at desktop speeds whilst consuming laptop-grade power. They are confident enough to say this because the iPad Pro 2020, with their A12Z processors are indeed faster than many, many laptops out there. As a representation, it runs Fortnite at 120 FPS. To the gamers out there, that’s 120Hz refresh rate display on an iPad. That’s faster than a PS4 or Xbox can run. Desktop processors can be even more impressive. They would be on a whole new level. Apple Silicon, which uses ARM architecture is amazing great at giving high performance at low power/wattage. This means that, theoretically, you can get Core-i9 performance whilst consuming less than 150 watts (this is just me, I don’t have anything to back it up with).</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">macOS Big Sur - another island off the coast of California, just like Catalina Island. (I just realized that when you type “Big Sur”, the Sur is highlighted as an incorrectly spelled word) It looks, quite frankly, like iPadOS. In Apple’s defense, they are pushing for continuity in their products and OS, so it is only a matter of time before they overhaul their desktop OS. macOS Big Sur has its goods and bads, just like everything else. It will have a fresh new UI, newly update Xcode and Safari, and much more. However, I really have an aversion for their new symbols. I like them in iPadOS and iOS, but not in desktop OSes. It just feels too “mobile-like”. But hey, new chip, new UI, new OS. Huge year for Apple’s desktop products compared to last year. Also, Apple finally got rid of the 10.XX.XX numbering, deciding to go from 10.XX.XX to 11.XX.XX (after around 2 decades in 10.XX.XX).</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">iOS 14. I mean, I don’t use a phone in daily use, and I really don’t care what OS I use. Android and iOS are both fine, but I do prefer iOS. They haven’t overhauled the design or the OS, just some cool stuff that, as EVERYBODY has pointed out, has been on Android since forever. Widgets, app list, just to name a few. Unlock your car with your iPhone, and “half-apps” so you can do stuff in an app without downloading it. Cool stuff.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">There wasn’t much for iPad OS either. Nothing much I really deem important, as I just use my iPad as my gaming “laptop” and “phone”. You can go watch the WWDC 2020 recaps and get your own info.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">P.S. AMD is still better than Intel in most applications</p>

    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Who has the better gaming setup? Who has the most productive setup? Those are questions that have been quarreled about for decades in Reddit and the like. You know, those people flexing their RTX 2080 Ti and the tons of RGB lighting. Nobody’s fingerprint is the same, just like someone’s setup. You might be a gamer and have tons of RGB and a cool gaming chair. Your neighbor, who might be a 3D animator, might have a super high end PC that’s not for gaming and probably a color accurate monitor. Your dog’s friend’s owner might have a 10 year old laptop that probably can’t do anything well today, but he/she insists that it is all he/she will ever need. Setups vary from person to person, and there’s NOTHING to say that your setup is bad. The only thing that is ever bad about one’s setup is if it cannot do what it is meant to do. I think that my setup is a great example of a super unique setup. I have what I call the “dual laptop mac/windows workstation”. Yes, I have 2 laptops that I use with a monitor, but that is taking into account how much better laptops have become now. My Razer Blade Stealth and my MacBook Pro 13 are the <em>perfect</em> combo. One is relatively high performance whilst being a 13 inch laptop, whilst the other one is slower but runs macOS, which I am highly accustomed to. I have a dock configured so that I can hot swap both laptops. All it needs is a USB-C port. That means I can accommodate ANY laptop that has a USB-C port (and 13 inch form factor). This is just me. It does everything I want it to do. Run Windows and macOS natively (yes I can boot-camp in Mac but bluetooth doesn’t work). OK, enough about me.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="8">What do YOU need?<br>
    What do YOU want to do in your setup?<br>
    What OS do you want to run?</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Using these 3 questions can give you a rough idea of how it should run and look like. My setup values portability, as I can unplug my computer at any time and bring it on the go. Also, the battery acts like a UPS that runs for 8+ hours. Combined that gives my 16 hours of computer use even if my power goes out (there won’t be wifi so there won’t be much point). I think that the performance sacrifices are worth it. You, however, might want a dedicated UPS and a full gaming rig. Your friend might simply want a MacBook for school. It varies from person to person, and it is up to YOU to determine what is best for YOU.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">P.S. NOBODY should convince you to change your setup as long as YOU’RE happy with it.</p>

    <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=1 data-line-end=2><a id="FPS_and_Hertz_Refresh_Rate_1"></a>FPS and Hertz (Refresh Rate)</h2>
    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">FPS and refresh rate. It is so pervasive in the gaming community. However, many people don’t even know what it is - they just know that the higher the better.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="7">FPS<br>
    FPS (frames per second) is how many images the GPU sends to the monitor per second. Each “frame” is an image, and the more the better. Why is that so? Well, they more FPS, the faster the keys register into the game. However, this doesn’t not always mean that you are seeing, say, 100 frames per second.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="10">Hz<br>
    Hertz (refresh rate) is how fast the display is refreshing per second. If the display is 60Hz (it is generally the standard for most monitors), it means it will show a new image every 1/60 of a second. If the display is at, say 300Hz, it will show a new image every 1/300 of a second. Now, obviously, the more images you see, they better you will game. It means that you will see things in the game faster than others might, as in a multiplayer game. When FPS is less than the refresh rate, the frame will not refresh, or just stay the same. However, when the FPS and the refresh rate are mostly the same, you will get, say 240 frames per second, and you will SEE it. If you buy a 2080 Ti and game on your 10 year old monitor, chances are that you will only see some of the frames the GPU spits out. However, if you pair it up with a 240Hz monitor, you will probably see all the frames. Simply, FPS measures how well the GPU performs and refresh rate measures how well the monitor is.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="21">The common refresh rates for monitors are:<br>
    40Hz (not quite common)<br>
    60Hz (very common)<br>
    75Hz (not really common)<br>
    120Hz (quite common in gaming)<br>
    144Hz (quite common in gaming)<br>
    165Hz (rare)<br>
    240Hz (e-Sports pro level)<br>
    300Hz (e-Sports pro level+)<br>
    360Hz (not out yet but e-Sports pro level ++)</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">FPS is different in every game and with every GPU. Obviously, the more powerful the GPU is, the more FPS. However, the game, (i.e. how detailed it is, how many things it needs to process) will also affect FPS.</p>

    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">OK, I’m sure that almost every techy person already knows about Apple Silicon. Yes, goodbye Intel, hello in-house SOCs.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">Why does this really matter?<br>
    First of all, Apple’s been making their own chips for a really long time. They almost always perform top of class in the mobile industry. Think about it: the iPad Pro 2019-20 can run Fortnite at 120FPS, more than many computers are capable of. I’m not kidding when I say that they are FAST. They are also very cool and easy to cool, possible making Apple’s amazingly thin laptops even thinner (I think that there’s a point in which a laptop cannot get any thinner or else it would just feel flimsy). However, I think that it’s great. With ARM chips, they can get AMAZINGLY high battery life.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="10">What are ARM chips?<br>
    It is a computer architecture (like x86). However, UNLIKE x86, which uses CISC (complex instruction set computer), it uses RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which makes them very power efficient whilst maintaining that snappy feel. Apple LOVES optimization, so they might even be able to get away with minimal parts whilst giving you that high-end feel.<br>
    Think about it, iPhones are sometimes even faster than phones that have 10+ GB of RAM. iPhones only have around 3GB.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Needless to be said, I think that Intel is gonna get shaken up, the fact that one of their big buyers are gone (Apple will still keep rolling out Intel products as well for the time being). This is, I believe, a bigger trend for the integration (not merging) of iPadOS, iOS and macOS. It’s truly a revolutionizing time in the tech industry.</p>

    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">If you are a gamer, I’m sure you’ve heard of Razer. If you haven’t here’s some background knowledge that may or may not be helpful. Razer (spelled with an “e” not “o”) is a gaming hardware company that makes quite famous gaming gear, such as their Razer Blade laptop series and Razer mice and keyboard. They are huge. In 2014 (a long time ago), they already took up 31% of the gaming mice industry.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Ok, so why do they have a “Cult Following”? Well, in terms of Razer’s marketing, “cult” has a fully positive connotation. It’s like the Apple of gaming. Many people buy Razer gear just for the brand. There’s tens of thousands of people in the reddit group “Cult of Razer”. Why is that?</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Well, I will first attempt to answer from my perspective. I am a mobile gamer, so I don’t really have “hands-on” experience with too many Razer products. When it comes to gaming gear for PC, I go with Logitech G. Logitech is known for its reliability and “just-workability”. I have Logitech G keyboard and mice. However, I do have a Razer Blade Stealth Late-2019, and WOW! - I can tell you straight away that it is the Apple of gaming. Yes, there’s tons of things I dislike about it, but the build quality and the general “power” of it is AMAZING. And that “power” is why Razer can acquire such a large following.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">They lead the industry on many fronts. Like Apple, they have quite a large R&amp;D budget. Also, they are the go-to brand for gaming. There’s just no other brand in this area. If you want good gaming gear, go buy Razer. The hardware and software are industry-leading.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Here’s what they have to say about it on <a href="https://inverstor.razer.com">investor.razer.com</a>: “Razer™ is the world’s leading lifestyle brand for gamers. The triple-headed snake trademark of Razer is one of the most recognized logos in the global gaming and esports communities. With a fan base that spans every continent, the company has designed and built the world’s largest gamer-focused ecosystem of hardware, software and services. Razer’s award-winning hardware includes high-performance gaming peripherals and Blade gaming laptops. Razer’s software platform, with over 80 million users, includes Razer Synapse (an Internet of Things platform), Razer Chroma (a proprietary RGB lighting technology system), and Razer Cortex (a game optimizer and launcher).”</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Yes. Like Apple, it has turned into a life-style that people live and breath. It’s the fact that they make EVERYTHING gaming to a reliable degree, and with that, people build setups. With setups, people like them to have unison (i.e. one brand, on color scheme). With Razer’s amazing good RGB and the fact that they cover EVERYTHING gaming, there’s just no way to compete. They are simply the top-dog of the high-end gaming industry.</p>

<!--BLOG #9: MACOS BIG SUR-->

    <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=1 data-line-end=2><a id="macOS_Big_Sur_1"></a>macOS Big Sur</h2>
    <h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Well, it’s here. MacOS Big Sur. I’ve been using the public beta for a couple days, and it’s really been an interesting ride. First, I’ll go over how I got it, and later will be going into my experiences. There’s some really interesting stats that might surprise you.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">I was watching TechLinked a couple days ago, and it said that the public betas for iOS 14 and iPadOS were out, so I assumed that the betas for Big Sur would be out as well. I checked on Apple’s site, and MAN it’s confusing. On Apple’s site, it says “Coming Soon”, even though it’s already out (it still says “Coming Soon”). I’ve never done a public beta install, and it was pretty eye opening. I enrolled my Mac, and did all the steps. AND ALL I GOT WAS THE CATALINA 10.15.6 BETA. WHO IN THE WORLD WANTS THAT?!?!?!?! So I looked on Apple forums, and I wasn’t the only one. Some said that following Mr. Macintosh’s tutorials allowed them to download the Big Sur beta, so I gave it a try. AND IT WORKED! YAY! So I got the “Install macOS Big Sur Beta Application”. I wanted to simply boot it off a USB stick. However, it just wouldn’t work. I don’t know why, but I really just wanted to try Big Sur for the first time. So, I made another APFS volume on my disk and I installed the beta on the volume. It booted and I was in Big Sur. So, in the end, it took 24h from finding out about the beta to actually seeing it. Yay.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Everything is much more rounded, but it doesn’t cut text off or anything. If anything, it makes macOS look more user-friendly and, for the Power-users, doesn’t do anything much. I’ve basically only been using Big Sur for around 3 days, and I’ve had almost 0 problems. EVERYTHING works. I’ve tried a couple apps, such as Blender and Cinebench, Discord and Spotify. THEY ALL WORK!</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Looks are generally what Apple has been changing this time around. As a consumer, there’s nothing much that changed. Finder is still Finder, and Safari is still a good browser. However, under the hood, there has been MASSIVE changes. Here’s my stats: my Blender Render took 12 seconds less with Big Sur and in Cinebench, scored 25 points higher with Big Sur. I only tried it once per operating system. There might be some junk in Catalina that I didn’t clean out, but I’m not really sure. I did try to keep it the same, however. I quitted all other apps, and made sure that renders were on the same settings. So, I can say with quite a bit of confidence that Big Sur might make your computer run 2-6% faster.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">So, that’s all I probably will say about Big Sur. It’s pretty awesome. Try it out for yourself, maybe.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">P.S. Back up your computer, please.</p>
