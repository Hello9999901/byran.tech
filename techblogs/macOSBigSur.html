<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Well, it’s here. MacOS Big Sur. I’ve been using the public beta for a couple days, and it’s really been an interesting ride. First, I’ll go over how I got it, and later will be going into my experiences. There’s some really interesting stats that might surprise you.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">I was watching TechLinked a couple days ago, and it said that the public betas for iOS 14 and iPadOS were out, so I assumed that the betas for Big Sur would be out as well. I checked on Apple’s site, and MAN it’s confusing. On Apple’s site, it says “Coming Soon”, even though it’s already out (it still says “Coming Soon”). I’ve never done a public beta install, and it was pretty eye opening. I enrolled my Mac, and did all the steps. AND ALL I GOT WAS THE CATALINA 10.15.6 BETA. WHO IN THE WORLD WANTS THAT?!?!?!?! So I looked on Apple forums, and I wasn’t the only one. Some said that following Mr. Macintosh’s tutorials allowed them to download the Big Sur beta, so I gave it a try. AND IT WORKED! YAY! So I got the “Install macOS Big Sur Beta Application”. I wanted to simply boot it off a USB stick. However, it just wouldn’t work. I don’t know why, but I really just wanted to try Big Sur for the first time. So, I made another APFS volume on my disk and I installed the beta on the volume. It booted and I was in Big Sur. So, in the end, it took 24h from finding out about the beta to actually seeing it. Yay.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Everything is much more rounded, but it doesn’t cut text off or anything. If anything, it makes macOS look more user-friendly and, for the Power-users, doesn’t do anything much. I’ve basically only been using Big Sur for around 3 days, and I’ve had almost 0 problems. EVERYTHING works. I’ve tried a couple apps, such as Blender and Cinebench, Discord and Spotify. THEY ALL WORK!</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Looks are generally what Apple has been changing this time around. As a consumer, there’s nothing much that changed. Finder is still Finder, and Safari is still a good browser. However, under the hood, there has been MASSIVE changes. Here’s my stats: my Blender Render took 12 seconds less with Big Sur and in Cinebench, scored 25 points higher with Big Sur. I only tried it once per operating system. There might be some junk in Catalina that I didn’t clean out, but I’m not really sure. I did try to keep it the same, however. I quitted all other apps, and made sure that renders were on the same settings. So, I can say with quite a bit of confidence that Big Sur might make your computer run 2-6% faster.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">So, that’s all I probably will say about Big Sur. It’s pretty awesome. Try it out for yourself, maybe.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">P.S. Back up your computer, please.</p>
