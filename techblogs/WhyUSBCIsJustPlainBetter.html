<h5 class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">A couple years ago, USB-C began appearing on many devices. For me, the first device that had USB-C was probably my MacBook Pro. At first, I hated it. “Why in the world is there a NEW port?” I wondered. Later on, I realized the importance and the novelty of this new port. MacBooks have 2/4 Thunderbolt 3 ports. This means that each port is capable of 40 gigabits/second. That is probably one of the fastest consumer ports/wires ever. Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C as a port. This means that USB-C will probably be the fasts port, looking down at USB.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">The best thing about USB-C for me is the fact that it can be split up into so many other ports. For example, a little dock can split a USB-C connection into power, HDMI and USB. This is just the beginning. There’s a reason why Apple didn’t add so many ports. They wanted to keep it simple. They chose USB-C because it can be expanded to ANY other connection variant.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Another thing is that USB-C can be plugged in up/down. It doesn’t matter which direction you plug it in, unlike USB.</p>
