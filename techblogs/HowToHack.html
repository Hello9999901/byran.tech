	<h2 class="blogtitle" >How to Hack (WORK IN PROGRESS!)</h2>
	<p class="blogtext">You've come to learn how to "hack". You'll probably be sad to find that there is not a secret to breaking into someone else's laptop or
        anything of that general vincinity. First, it's illegal except with explicit permission and it's rather difficult and tedious, especially for 
        anyone who isn't a "hacker" already.
        <br>
        <br>
        DISCLAIMER: This is for educational purposes ONLY. I take NO responsibilites of your actions. (Sorry if I sound rude, just had to get that out of the way.)
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">Onwards!</p>

    <img src="../image/Tutorial Images/HowToHack/top.png" class="blogimage" style="margin-left: 60px;">
    <p class="photocaption">Terminal running top, a computer monitoring program.</p>
    <p class="blogtext">If you have seen any "hacker" in any movie ever, the screen is flashing with 0s and 1s, windows are poping up all the time, the green text is unreadable to the untrained.
        It might look something like this:

    <img src="../image/Tutorial Images/HowToHack/powermetrics.png" class="blogimage" style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <p class="photocaption">Terminal running powermetrics, an advanced computer monitoring program.</p>
    <p class="blogtext">Movies actually get this right. Terminal is something every hacker uses. Though it may seem scary, it's actually very simple.
        Simple in the sense its easy to use, and simple in the sense it can easily break your computer. Here are a few interesting (albiet scary) commands!
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">1. sudo rm -rf /</p>
    <p class="code">&nbspsudo rm -rf /</p>
    <p class="blogtext">The command "sudo rm -rf /" is an infamous command that erases EVERYTHING in a computer. 
        <br>
        Perhaps we should take a more detailed look into what this does. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "sudo" is a prefix that is put in front of
        any command that needs or should have superuser access. "Superuser" provides system adminitrator level access.
        <br>
        <br>
        "rm" is used to delete files. In this case, it is deleting everything. The reason it is deleting everything 
        is because / is the main directory, and all files branch off "/". In the middle, 
        <br>
        <br>
        "-rf" are the options.
        <br>
        "r" is an option to delete everything under the directory and all sub-directories after. 
        <br>
        "f" is an option 
        to force delete files. It will override many protections. However, it will not override write-protected directories.
