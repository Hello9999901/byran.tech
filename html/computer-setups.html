                    <p>Who has the better gaming setup? Who has the most productive setup? Those are questions that have
                        been quarreled
                        about for decades in Reddit and the like. You know, those people flexing their RTX 2080 Ti and
                        the tons of RGB
                        lighting. Nobody‚Äôs fingerprint is the same, just like someone‚Äôs setup.
                        You might be a gamer and have tons of RGB and a cool gaming chair. Your neighbor, who might be a
                        3D animator,
                        might have a super high end PC that‚Äôs not for gaming and probably a color accurate monitor. Your
                        dog‚Äôs friend‚Äôs
                        owner might have a 10 year old laptop that probably can‚Äôt do anything well today, but he/she
                        insists that it is
                        all he/she will ever need.
                        Setups vary from person to person, and there‚Äôs NOTHING to say that your setup is bad. The only
                        thing that is
                        ever bad about one‚Äôs setup is if it cannot do what it is meant to do. I think that my setup is a
                        great example
                        of a super unique setup.
                        I have what I call the ‚Äúdual laptop mac/windows workstation‚Äù. Yes, I have 2 laptops that I use
                        with a monitor,
                        but that is taking into account how much better laptops have become now.
                        My Razer Blade Stealth and my MacBook Pro 13 are the <em>perfect</em> combo. One is relatively
                        high performance
                        whilst being a 13 inch laptop, whilst the other one is slower but runs macOS, which I am highly
                        accustomed to. I
                        have a dock configured so that I can hot swap both laptops. All it needs is a USB-C port.
                        That means I can accommodate ANY laptop that has a USB-C port (and 13 inch form factor). This is
                        just me.
                        It does everything I want it to do. Run Windows and macOS natively (yes I can boot-camp in Mac
                        but bluetooth
                        doesn‚Äôt work). OK, enough about me.</p>
                    <p>What do YOU need?
                        What do YOU want to do in your setup?
                        What OS do you want to run?</p>
                    <p>Using these 3 questions can give you a rough idea of how it should run and look like. My setup
                        values
                        portability, as I can unplug my computer at any time and bring it on the go. Also, the battery
                        acts like a UPS
                        that runs for 8+ hours. Combined that gives my 16 hours of computer use even if my power goes
                        out (there won‚Äôt
                        be wifi so there won‚Äôt be much point).
                        I think that the performance sacrifices are worth it. You, however, might want a dedicated UPS
                        and a full gaming
                        rig. Your friend might simply want a MacBook for school. It varies from person to person, and it
                        is up to YOU to
                        determine what is best for YOU.</p>
                    <p>P.S. NOBODY should convince you to change your setup as long as YOU‚ÄôRE happy with it.</p>
