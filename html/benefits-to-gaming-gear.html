                    <p>Why would one want gaming gear? Well, there are many benefits to gaming gear other than gaming, which is probably
                        what most people buy them for. First of all, they are much more comfortable than normal tech.</p>
                    <p>Just compare a your office mouse to a well kitted out gaming mouse. To this argument you might pose the following
                        answer: ‚ÄúWell, an ergonomic mouse would do just fine.‚Äù To answer that, I would like to go on a tangent. First,
                        gaming mice are probably the most responsive mice you‚Äôll ever try. They also have the best sensors. These two
                        are things that are almost oblivious to ergonomic mice or ‚Äúoffice mice‚Äù.</p>
                    <p>I‚Äôll pose another example: say you are buying a keyboard. Buy an office keyboard or a better keyboard? Oh, you
                        just heard your friend say that he just bought a mechanical keyboard and it‚Äôs the BEST keyboard he‚Äôs ever tried?
                        Well, say no more. For $40, you can get your hands on a very comparable mechanical keyboard. You try it, and
                        it‚Äôs not as amazing as your friend said. Then, you try your laptop‚Äôs keyboard and you realize that it‚Äôs not just
                        the longer travel, it‚Äôs the FEEL of the keyboard. There‚Äôs no turning back. I know I‚Äôm groundlessly saying this,
                        but it‚Äôs really worth the more cash. What‚Äôs the biggest market for mechanical keyboard? Gaming and programming.
                        Who uses and advocates for mechanical keyboards the most? Gamers. So, who sells them? Gaming gear brands. That
                        basically forces you to buy mechanical keyboards from gaming brands. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs gonna have sharp
                        edges and the absolutely brightest RGB in the world. Buying from a reputable gaming brand can result in a
                        keyboard that you can trust on for years to come.</p>
                    <p>There are so many things that many people have never tried but gamers use on a regular basis, such as high
                        refresh rate, high resolution mouse sensors and mechanical keyboards. I‚Äôve covered the last 2 already. High
                        refresh rate is something that not many people have tried. Almost all high refresh rate monitors are branded as
                        gaming. I have not tried one, but it sounds promising from literally every single tech enthusiast.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, and perhaps the thing I value most, is the SOFTWARE. Yes, it might be buggy, yes, it might be low-res.
                        Yes, it may take up resources and RAM that can be used otherwise. However, it‚Äôs the ability to do WHATEVER you
                        want with ALL THE EXTRA BUTTONS on the mice and keyboards. Without the software, your gaming mouse is basically
                        just a glorified office mouse. The software is KEY to me. I use it 24/7. Logitech G Hub is very good considering
                        the fact that Logitech doesn‚Äôt usually make software. It‚Äôs not as feature packed as many others, such as Razer
                        Synapse, but it‚Äôs the ability to customize the 11 customizable buttons I have on my mouse. They are so useful if
                        you installed the software, yet so useless if you didn‚Äôt. I use macros on my mouse for switching between
                        desktops and tabs, mission control, DPI switching and many more.</p>
                    <p>Gaming gear is much more than just the RGB and the hype. It‚Äôs actually worthwhile if you don‚Äôt go for bad/sketchy
                        brands at lower prices.</p>
                    <p>P.S. Yes it‚Äôs expensive, but it probably will outlast your office mouse.</p>
