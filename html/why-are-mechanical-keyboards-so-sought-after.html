                <div id="body">
                    <p>Why are they so sought after? First, we must turn to what
                        a mechanical keyboard is. I am not talking about what they are, their technical specifications
                        or their advertising.
                        I would like to recognize what the redeeming qualities of mechanical keyboards really are. I am
                        typing on a Logitech
                        G610 Orion Blue, which has Cherry MX Blue switches. This is important, as switches make quite
                        the difference in the
                        typing experience. The polar opposite of mechanical switches are membrane switches. They are the
                        ones found in your
                        average office keyboard that costs the grand total of 10 bucks. Never mind, they are fine and
                        one can type on them.
                        That is because they have never tired a mechanical keyboard. Once you've tried one, you will
                        never forget that
                        there's a whole other world, a community of enthusiasts, making and experimenting with
                        mechanical keyboards. I
                        personally only have experience with Blue switches, meaning that they are ‚Äúclicky‚Äù. That also
                        means they are loud.
                        The travel is long compared to a membrane keyboard, and much more comfortable. It is really
                        amazing. When you press
                        down on the keycaps, you can feel the actuation point, the point in which the key registers to
                        the computer. You
                        know exactly where and how to press the key so that the timing is perfect. This is tremendously
                        important to gaming,
                        as each keypress can mean the difference between life and death in-game. Now, you might think: I
                        know when my key
                        registers to my computer in a membrane keyboard! Well, not really. For Blue switches, there's
                        around a millimeter of
                        travel from the key moving to the key actuating. I don't know why, but it just feels so much
                        better.</p>
                    <p>Mechanical keyboards are good, but they are not cheap. A
                        good, full-size mechanical keyboard from a trustworthy manufacture would set you back around
                        70-100+ dollars.
                        However, I believe that it is worth it. These keyboards feel much better and would last longer
                        than your 10 dollar
                        keyboard. People correlate mechanical keyboards to ‚Äúgaming keyboards‚Äù, but that really isn't
                        accurate. ‚ÄúGaming‚Äù
                        things can be important, but they are generally a way for the companies to charge more on a
                        product. My keyboard is
                        marketed as ‚Äúgaming‚Äù, but I almost never use it for gaming, and it works just fine. ‚ÄúGaming‚Äù
                        keyboards can be good,
                        however. For example, most gaming keyboards have software that come with it, allowing for macros
                        and key binds to be
                        put in place. I have also seen SteelSeries keyboards have variable actuation points. These are
                        all good things about
                        gaming keyboards. I don't really have anything bad to say about gaming keyboards other than the
                        issue that
                        manufacturers overuse the term in marketing. Yes, almost all ‚ÄúGAMING‚Äù keyboards are mechanical,
                        but some are cheap
                        and are marketed as ‚Äúmechanical feel‚Äù. They are cheap, but they aren't mechanical. They are just
                        more stable
                        mechanical switches with more travel. I'll end it here. There you have it, not really all that
                        complicated. If you
                        want to know which keyboard switch is right for you, search it up on google and take a small
                        switch quiz to find
                        which is right for you.</p>
                    <p>P.S. Cherry MX is the gold standard for switches. Buy those if you can (Unless you know your key
                        switches really well).</p>
