                    <p>There's no need in explaining the fact that Apple's
                        products are so expensive. The memes going around about the $6000 monitor and the $999 stand,
                        the MacBook Air with a
                        cooling fan that doesn't cool the CPU, and the Mac Pro that probably costs just as much as your
                        car when fully
                        kitted out. The memes, to my opinion, are oblivious to the REAL reason why Apple charges what
                        seems like an stupidly
                        high amount of money to customers.</p>
                    <p>From many, many reviewers both on YouTube and in the
                        media, it has come down to several reasons. I will credit the $999 stand to LTT, the MacBook Air
                        cooling problem to
                        LTT as well, and the Mac Pro to MKBHD and LTT.</p>
                    <p>First things first: the Pro Display XDR with the $5999
                        price tag and $999 stand. There's actually 2 very comparable reasons why Apple charges so much.
                        I was considering
                        one until I found out about the price. The 2 reasons are these; 1: They actually don't cost much
                        at all if you think
                        about it, and 2: Apple wants to define itself as a luxury brand so people don't think of it as a
                        ‚Äúpeasant brand‚Äù.
                        You might say that $5999 is too much for ANY monitor! Well, you're wrong. Large studios use
                        monitors that cost tens
                        of thousands of dollars. Just look at this monitor! It costs 40,000 dollars. It is a 4K HDR
                        monitor used in movie
                        production and more. With the Pro Display XDR with its 6K HDR monitor, it seems surprisingly
                        cheap. Obviously it's
                        not as HDR and not as bright as the 40,000 dollar monitor, but it seems to be good enough for
                        the general public. In
                        conclusion, it's actually really cheap considering that there's 40,000 dollar monitors with
                        lower resolution than
                        the Pro Display XDR. Secondly, Apple wants to define itself as a luxury brand. It's not
                        surprising that not too many
                        financially deprived people buy MacBooks. People buy Apple laptops and other Apple products
                        because everyone else
                        has them. When I say everyone else, just look at everyone's phones at school I dare say that
                        +50% own some
                        Apple-branded product. When you look at everyone's phones and laptops, you go and say: well, it
                        seems like a GREAT
                        choice, that Apple. That's what I thought when I purchased my laptop. Now, as I learn more and
                        more about computers
                        and consumer tech, I realize that maybe this particular laptop wasn't exactly the BEST choice.
                        Don't get me wrong,
                        I'm not a spoiled brat who wants 40,000 dollar monitors and the BEST of the BEST laptops. I just
                        have some regrets
                        about it that I found out about until now. Back to the topic. Many people buy Apple products not
                        because they are
                        the fastest phones/tablets in the world, rather, they buy them for their ‚Äúluxury‚Äù. It's hard to
                        explain, just like
                        why you probably have a iPhone lying around in your house or something.</p>
                    <p>MacBook Air cooling issue: Ok, this one's pretty easy
                        if I go with LTT's ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù So the A12Z SoC in the iPad Pro 2020 generates around 4-5
                        watts of
                        heat per core, and only one core can really be at full potential due to cooling/thermal
                        limitations. There are 4
                        high performing cores and (I believe) 12 energy saving cores. As Apple has said, they are
                        transitioning to their own
                        custom silicon over the next 2 years. They probably will somewhat use the A12Z's structure and
                        just kinda overclock
                        it and put it to its fullest potential. How much heat would that generate, if the A12Z is at
                        full potential? 16
                        Watts. How much does the tiny heatsink on Apple's MacBook Air absorb? Around 16 Watts. Does this
                        make sense? Maybe.
                        What Linus is trying to say is that the MBA might just have a CPU change and nothing much else
                        done. Hmmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, the Mac Pro. Fully kitted out, it costs a
                        measly $52,447.98. I mean, who can't afford that, right? It only costs 10,000 dollars more than
                        an Audi TT. WHY IN
                        THE WORLD DOES APPLE DO THAT??? To answer this question, we need to look at WHY it costs
                        $52,000. What I mean is
                        fact of what component costs the most. All the memes make fun at the Mac Pro as an whole, but
                        that might not be
                        exactly accurate. The RAM in the Mac Pro costs 25,000 dollars if the 1.5 TB choice is selected.
                        If you upgrade it by
                        yourself, which is probably what many people will do, it only costs $12,499.99, which is half
                        the price of the RAM
                        Apple offers. The 28 core Xeon CPU in the Mac Pro costs $2999.00, which is the recommended sales
                        price on <a href="https://intel.com">intel.com</a>. So, actually, there are many things Apple
                        can't control, such as the
                        price of RAM and the price of Intel CPUs (They do overprice the RAM). Intel actually rips off
                        customers a lot, with
                        their not-so-good performance at a high price. That's one factor. There are things Apple can't
                        control. The other is
                        that not many people are going to buy the Mac Pro in the first place, and the people that want
                        to buy one probably
                        has the money to. An editor who is accomplished enough to even think of buying a Mac Pro
                        probably has the money to.
                        Lastly, it's not about what Apple wants to offer to people. Yes, it's an amazingly well done
                        machine. However, it's
                        not really meant for the general public, unlike a MacBook Pro or an iPhone. It's meant for
                        others, who know what
                        they are getting into and know exactly what they need.</p>
