                    <p>Apple announced Apple Silicon. I wanted parts of the event. When Apple announced M1, I knew the
                        future had
                        arrived. As usual, the video was amazingly well-made and the specs (or the lack of) made it
                        something
                        intriguing. I purchased a MBP 13‚Äô the day after they were released. This is not a purchasing
                        guide or review,
                        but rather an ‚Äúessay‚Äù through the perspective of a ‚Äútech nerd, a true tech nerd‚Äù - Dave Lee.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cinebench:</p>
                    <p>I got around 7737 on multi-core. That‚Äôs some serious speed for a laptop that never even gets hot
                        to the touch. It
                        is cool to the touch when doing light workloads, and becomes slightly warm after Rosetta 2
                        Blender renders and
                        use-cases similar to that. </p>
                    <p>Speaking of Rosetta 2, the emulation is great. However, there are many applications that do not
                        work. <a href="https://www.doesitarm.com" class="bloglink" style="margin-left: 0px;">Does it
                            ARM?</a> is a great
                        resource to check if your favorite apps are supported or not. </p>
                    <p>Everything feels snappy and quick. Opening Xcode no longer takes 10 hours (or so it seems). As
                        Austin Evans would
                        agree on, M1 MacBooks are now the automatic laptop recommendation for the average user. </p>
                    <p>However, with such a large changed, there are many places that are much changed and unfortunately
                        dead. First,
                        dual booting is 99% dead, unless someone can make a OS with a boot loader and all that stuff I
                        know nothing
                        about. At the same time, csrutil disable to disable the SIP and security functions don‚Äôt do much
                        now. I tried (I
                        might not have done it the right way though) with no luck. Secondly, iPhone and iPad apps don‚Äôt
                        actually just
                        download. Since developers have the choice to have their app available on Apple Silicon Macs or
                        not, many choose
                        NO.
                        Here are just a few COD: Mobile, Clash of Clans, Snapchat, Instagram, and much, MUCH more. Of
                        course, have the
                        ability to download iOS and iPad OS apps should not be your main reason to buy one. </p>
                    <p>The looks have stayed the same, and now there are only 2 Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 ports. Why? I guess
                        nobody knows. (EDIT: The lack of ports could be due to the M1 SoC's inherent limitations)
                    </p>
                    <p>The Apple Silicon M1 Macs are the BEST Macs ever made. Apple has combined all the failures they
                        have learned over
                        the past few years (butterfly keyboard, thermal throttling, etc.) and fixed 99% of them going
                        into the Apple
                        Silicon Macs. Even thought I said this wasn‚Äôt going to be a buyer‚Äôs guide, I have to say this:
                        Now‚Äôs a great
                        time to buy a Mac. </p>
