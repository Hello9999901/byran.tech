                    <p>Well, it's here. MacOS Big Sur. I've been using the
                        public beta for a couple days, and it's really been an interesting ride. First, I'll go over how
                        I got it, and later
                        will be going into my experiences. There's some really interesting stats that might surprise
                        you.</p>
                    <p>I was watching TechLinked a couple days ago, and it said
                        that the public betas for iOS 14 and iPadOS were out, so I assumed that the betas for Big Sur
                        would be out as well.
                        I checked on Apple's site, and MAN it's confusing. On Apple's site, it says ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù, even
                        though it's already
                        out (it still says ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù). I've never done a public beta install, and it was pretty eye
                        opening. I enrolled
                        my Mac, and did all the steps. AND ALL I GOT WAS THE CATALINA 10.15.6 BETA. WHO IN THE WORLD
                        WANTS THAT?!?!?!?! So I
                        looked on Apple forums, and I wasn't the only one. Some said that following Mr. Macintosh's
                        tutorials allowed them
                        to download the Big Sur beta, so I gave it a try. AND IT WORKED! YAY! So I got the ‚ÄúInstall
                        macOS Big Sur Beta
                        Application‚Äù. I wanted to simply boot it off a USB stick. However, it just wouldn't work. I
                        don't know why, but I
                        really just wanted to try Big Sur for the first time. So, I made another APFS volume on my disk
                        and I installed the
                        beta on the volume. It booted and I was in Big Sur. So, in the end, it took 24h from finding out
                        about the beta to
                        actually seeing it. Yay.</p>
                    <p>Everything is much more rounded, but it doesn't cut text
                        off or anything. If anything, it makes macOS look more user-friendly and, for the Power-users,
                        doesn't do anything
                        much. I've basically only been using Big Sur for around 3 days, and I've had almost 0 problems.
                        EVERYTHING works.
                        I've tried a couple apps, such as Blender and Cinebench, Discord and Spotify. THEY ALL WORK!</p>
                    <p>Looks are generally what Apple has been changing this
                        time around. As a consumer, there's nothing much that changed. Finder is still Finder, and
                        Safari is still a good
                        browser. However, under the hood, there has been MASSIVE changes. Here's my stats: my Blender
                        Render took 12 seconds
                        less with Big Sur and in Cinebench, scored 25 points higher with Big Sur. I only tried it once
                        per operating system.
                        There might be some junk in Catalina that I didn't clean out, but I'm not really sure. I did try
                        to keep it the
                        same, however. I quitted all other apps, and made sure that renders were on the same settings.
                        So, I can say with
                        quite a bit of confidence that Big Sur might make your computer run 2-6% faster.</p>
                    <p>So, that's all I probably will say about Big Sur. It's
                        pretty awesome. Try it out for yourself, maybe.</p>
                    <p>P.S. Back up your computer, please.</p>
