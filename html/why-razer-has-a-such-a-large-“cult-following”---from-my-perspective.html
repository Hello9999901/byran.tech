                    <p>If you are a gamer, I'm sure you've heard of Razer. If
                        you haven't here's some background knowledge that may or may not be helpful. Razer (spelled with
                        an ‚Äúe‚Äù not ‚Äúo‚Äù) is
                        a gaming hardware company that makes quite famous gaming gear, such as their Razer Blade laptop
                        series and Razer
                        mice and keyboard. They are huge. In 2014 (a long time ago), they already took up 31% of the
                        gaming mice industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ok, so why do they have a ‚ÄúCult Following‚Äù? Well, in
                        terms of Razer's marketing, ‚Äúcult‚Äù has a fully positive connotation. It's like the Apple of
                        gaming. Many people buy
                        Razer gear just for the brand. There's tens of thousands of people in the reddit group ‚ÄúCult of
                        Razer‚Äù. Why is that?
                    </p>
                    <p>Well, I will first attempt to answer from my perspective.
                        I am a mobile gamer, so I don't really have ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù experience with too many Razer products.
                        When it comes to
                        gaming gear for PC, I go with Logitech G. Logitech is known for its reliability and
                        ‚Äújust-workability‚Äù. I have
                        Logitech G keyboard and mice. However, I do have a Razer Blade Stealth Late-2019, and WOW! - I
                        can tell you straight
                        away that it is the Apple of gaming. Yes, there's tons of things I dislike about it, but the
                        build quality and the
                        general ‚Äúpower‚Äù of it is AMAZING. And that ‚Äúpower‚Äù is why Razer can acquire such a large
                        following.</p>
                    <p>They lead the industry on many fronts. Like Apple, they
                        have quite a large R&amp;D budget. Also, they are the go-to brand for gaming. There's just no
                        other brand in this
                        area. If you want good gaming gear, go buy Razer. The hardware and software are
                        industry-leading.</p>
                    <p>Here's what they have to say about it on <a
                            href="https://investor.razer.com">investor.razer.com</a>: ‚ÄúRazer‚Ñ¢ is the world's leading
                        lifestyle brand for
                        gamers. The triple-headed snake trademark of Razer is one of the most recognized logos in the
                        global gaming and
                        e-sports communities. With a fan base that spans every continent, the company has designed and
                        built the world's
                        largest gamer-focused ecosystem of hardware, software and services. Razer's award-winning
                        hardware includes
                        high-performance gaming peripherals and Blade gaming laptops. Razer's software platform, with
                        over 80 million users,
                        includes Razer Synapse (an Internet of Things platform), Razer Chroma (a proprietary RGB
                        lighting technology
                        system), and Razer Cortex (a game optimizer and launcher).‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Yes. Like Apple, it has turned into a life-style that
                        people live and breath. It's the fact that they make EVERYTHING gaming to a reliable degree, and
                        with that, people
                        build setups. With setups, people like them to have unison (i.e. one brand, on color scheme).
                        With Razer's amazing
                        good RGB and the fact that they cover EVERYTHING gaming, there's just no way to compete. They
                        are simply the top-dog
                        of the high-end gaming industry.</p>
