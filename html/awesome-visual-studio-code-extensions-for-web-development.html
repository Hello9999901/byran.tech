                    <p>Customizing Visual Studio Code is part of it's culture and blood. There are hundreds, if not
                        thousands of
                        extensions and themes available to make Visual Studio Code truly yours.</p>
                    <h2 id="super-cool">Super Cool</h2>
                    <p><strong>better-comments</strong><br>
                        Better Comments is an extension that makes beautiful (and therefore better) comments. The
                        extension highlights types of comments, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alerts</li>
                        <li>Queries</li>
                        <li>TODOs</li>
                        <li>Highlights</li>
                        <li>More types can be specified in settings</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>beautify</strong><br>
                        Beautify might be the most useful extension for web development. It can automatically format JS,
                        JSON, CSS, SASS,
                        and HTML. By simply assigning the extension to a keyboard shortcut, it can instantly make any
                        web dev file look
                        better.</p>
                    <p><strong>LiveServer</strong><br>
                        LiveServer quote (from README.md): <strong>"Launch a local development server with live reload
                            feature for
                            static &amp; dynamic pages."</strong><br> Simply put, it hosts a website on your own
                        computer,
                        (usually to port
                        5500). Every time you change something, it will automatically refresh the page! It is super
                        useful and super simple
                        to use.</p>
                    <p><strong>bracket-pair-colorizer-2</strong><br>
                        I think the name is pretty self-explanatory here; it highlights matching brackets, to make
                        matching different
                        bracket pairs a breeze.</p>
                    <p><strong>comment-anchors</strong><br>
                        Some features overlap with the better-comments extension, but Comment Anchors has a trick up its
                        sleeve. You can set
                        anchors in the comments, as markings to refer to later. On the sidebar, an anchor section will
                        appear, with every
                        "ANCHOR" you set appearing. You can jump to any of the anchors simply by pressing it.</p>
                    <p><strong>subtle-brackets</strong><br>
                        To enhance your bracket matching super-vision, you can use Subtle Match Brackets. This will
                        <em>subtly</em> match
                        your brackets by underlining them.</p>
                    <p><strong>code-spell-checker</strong><br>
                        With almost any type of standard casing (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, kebab-case) it will
                        check the spelling
                        of the text, comparing it against a dictionary. With many different languages, it will save you
                        much time finding
                        spelling errors in HTML, JS and CSS!</p>
                    <p><strong>better-align</strong><br>
                        Better Align allows variables (and code in general) to be aligned with a keyboard shortcut. CSS
                        variables, rejoice!
                        No more are the days of having misaligned variables. All variables will be perfectly aligned,
                        easy to read on one
                        line.</p>
                    <p><strong>markdown-all-in-one</strong><br>
                        Markdown All in One is too much to fit into a measly paragraph; with loads of keyboard shortcuts
                        for bold, italic,
                        bullets and more, TOC generation, auto preview, math and more, it is truly all you need for
                        Markdown in Visual
                        Studio Code. In my opinion, the preview feature is the most useful, as you can view processed
                        Markdown on another
                        window, so you know exactly how the Markdown will turn out.</p>
                    <h2 id="working-with-git--github">Working with Git + Github</h2>
                    <p><strong>gitlens</strong><br>
                        GitLens allows Git features to be augmented. You can view blames, code authorship, and
                        seamlessly see everything
                        about your Git repositories. The magic of GitLens is only seen when you try it out.</p>
                    <p><strong>vscode-pull-request-github</strong><br>
                        This is a great way to work with GitHub. Normally, PRs and Issues are hard to manage with
                        vanilla Visual Studio
                        Code. Now, it is a piece of cake!</p>
                    <h2 id="working-with-css">Working with CSS</h2>
                    <p><strong>color-highlight</strong><br>
                        This extension highlights colors in your CSS (and more)! It is super useful to see all the
                        colors in a glance. It
                        even works with color variables.</p>
                    <p><strong>classnametocss</strong><br>
                        This extension automatically syncs class names in CSS, so you always have your classes within
                        autocomplete'sll
                        reach.</p>
                    <h2 id="working-with-html">Working with HTML</h2>
                    <p><strong>path-intellisense</strong><br>
                        Path Intellisense is a powerful auto-complete for Visual Studio Code. It is better than the
                        included one, as this
                        one has lots of ways to customize, and has support for <code>srcset</code>.</p>
                    <p><strong>auto-rename-tag</strong><br>
                        Need to rename a tag, but hate changing both? Auto Rename Tag has got you covered. By changing
                        one tag, the other
                        one automatically matches!</p>
                    <p><strong>vscode-gutter-preview (Image preview)</strong><br>
                        This extension previews a plethora of image types in the gutter (between the sidebar and code
                        line numbers). The
                        extension scans your code for image paths, and displays a small version right there on the
                        gutter. This way, you can
                        view your images right alongside your code.</p>
                    <p><strong>rainbow-tags</strong><br>
                        This extensions artfully colorizes your code, to make tags and brackets easier to read and
                        associate!</p>
                    <h2 id="working-with-js">Working with JS</h2>
                    <p><strong>npm-intellisense</strong><br>
                        If you work with NPM (node package manager), then this is a must-have. When you need a package,
                        NPM intellisense
                        automatically completes import boilerplate code.</p>
                    <p><strong>vscode-language-babel</strong><br>
                        Quite simple; parses and highlights Babel JS.</p>
                    <p><strong>es6-string-html</strong><br>
                        When you are writing React CSS in JSX, you will see that the syntax is not highlighted, as the
                        syntax processor
                        thinks it's all just a long string. This extension solves this by highlighting all sorts of code
                        inside ES6
                        strings.</p>
                    <p><strong>vscodeintellicode</strong><br>
                        TL;DR: AI Autocomplete by Microsoft.</p>
                    <p><strong>JavaScriptSnippets</strong><br>
                        No doubt that JS has lots of boilerplate. Nobody likes typing it all out. This extension solves
                        this existential
                        problem.</p>
                    <h2 id="html--css">HTML + CSS</h2>
                    <p><strong>vscode-css-peek</strong><br>
                        Using this extension, you can see what styling each HTML class and id corresponds to, simply by
                        hovering over it.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>vscode-html-css</strong><br>
                        Big web page with lots of selectors and lots of naming schemes? This extension helps with CSS
                        class/id autocomplete,
                        saving you more time for actual design and debugging.</p>
                    <h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>
                    <p>These are amazing extensions for many uses; check them out, you won't regret it! Perhaps you
                        don't need them
                        now, but installing them might just save you later on.

                        In a sea of coding tutorials of the interwebs, how you present your code is vital. Polacode
                        generates beautiful code
                        images inside Visual Studio Code. The only downside is that there is, as far as I know, no line
                        numbering.</p>

                    <p><strong>vscode-quick-select</strong><br>
                        Most times, double clicking will select things within a paragraph, line, quotes, or brackets.
                        However, sometimes you
