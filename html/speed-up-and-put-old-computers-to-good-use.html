                        It is undeniable that old computers have a charm to them. It's like an old friend. There are many
                        ways to breath new life into old computers. Speeding them up means they can be useful once more.
                        Moreover, with a few changes here and there, you can put an old computer to good use, either simply
                        as a usable desktop or a mean, lean, server machine!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I will go from easiest to hardest (i.e. 1 is easiest, 2 is a little more difficult, etc.), but none
                        of these are rocket science and certainly nothing some patience and Googling can't fix.
                        <p>
                            <b>Note</b>: I will mix hardware changes and software changes. The ranking will also incorporate what has
                            the largest perceived performance increase.

                        risky on the "risky" scale.

                        <p><h2>1. Changing from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">Hard Disk Drive</a> (Hard Drive or simply HDD) to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">Solid State Drive </a>(SSD)</h2></p>

                            This will arguably have the largest perceived performance boost. A hard drive (referred to as
                            "spinning rust") physically spins around with a magnetic header that magnetizes portions of the
                            spinning disk into 0's or 1's (magnetized and non-magnetized). On the other hand, SSDs have "NAND
                            flashes". They use silicon and transistors to store 0's and 1's, making them "solid" and not moving.
                            SSD's are <b>much faster</b> than traditional HDD's. A few years back, SSD technology was still new, so
                            they were priced exorbitantly. However, as technology progressed, SSD prices have gotten cheaper and
                            cheaper. On a system with no fans, an SSD will make the computer <b>fully silent</b>. SSD's also posses
                            many more advantages other hard drives.

                                - SSDs are <b>5-15</b> times faster than hard drives

                            <li>
                                - The <b>failure rate of a SSD is lower than a hard drive</b>. Hard drives may also demagnetize over long
                                durations of time, possibly corrupting data.
                            </li>
                            <li>- SSDs consume around <b>half as much power</b> as hard drives, as they do not spin or move in any form.</li>
                            <li>
                                - This will translate to a <b>fast and snappy experience</b> when opening files and applications, greatly
                                increasing boot (restart) times and possibly <b>increase the battery life</b> on laptops.

                            <li>
                                - SSDs are available in smaller sizes than hard drives and do not hold as much data for the same
                                price. <b>However, space will not be a problem anymore with the third tip</b>

                        <p>
                            Installing more RAM (random access memory) will benefit the system by allowing the system to store
                            more data in a quickly accessible place. Memory and storage are two very different things. They both
                            store data, but the data stored in RAM is volatile, meaning it does not stay there forever. However,
                            it is much faster than storage. This means that frequently accessed data, for the operating system
                            itself and more, are stored in RAM. With more RAM, the computer can store more things in there,
                            meaning more things will be faster. This will lead to a snappy experience and faster performance.
                            There are many types of RAM, so it is important to watch out for what type of RAM your computer may
                            use.

                                out for which one your computer uses. DDR3 is older and DDR4 is newer. Almost every laptop built in
                                the <b>last 5 years uses DDR4</b>, but you might want to double check just in case.

                                so you can upgrade it to 8 gigabytes in total by plugging in another stick of 4 gigabyte DDR3

                            Many will wonder the same question: what is Linux? Linux is an open source (the code itself is
                            freely available to everyone to view and revise) operating system created Linus Torvalds. Its
                            philosophy is "with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow". A counterargument can be made here. If
                            anyone can see the code, then anyone can find flaws and exploit them, right? That is in fact a
                            fallacy, as those who maintain and support Linux will have already seen the flaw and fixed it. There
                            are more good people in the world than bad, and those good people will fix flaws in Linux as time
                            progresses. This means that Linux is very lightweight and easy to run compared to Windows or even
                            macOS. Due to its open source nature, it is incredibly stable. It is so stable that almost every
                            single server in the world runs a form of Linux. Wait... a form of Linux? That's right. Linus
                            Torvalds created the Linux *kernel*, which is the central process that controls how the operating
                            system handles everything in a system. However, there are thousands of different implementations of
                            Linux in the world right now, all of them open source as well. Linux's advantages are many! A few of
                            them are:

                        <p>
                            Obviously, a simple choice would be to install some Linux distro and use it like a normal computer.
                            But what if I told you there was *another way*? With Linux, running a server, be it a website, file
                            server, email server, code server, render farm, or whatever you want? I will introduce you to
                            various uses for a computer <b>other</b> than just using it.

                                    Apache HTTP Server is a <b>web server</b>, meaning it turns your computer into a website hosting machine!
                                    You have have it <b>host websites</b> in your local network, or to the entirety of the interwebs! It will
                                    serve a website will a few lines of code and some patience. What will you do with your brand new
                                    website?

                                    This is a file server operating system. It hosts files that you can <b>upload to and download from</b>. It is based on Debian (a distro as mentioned above). It is
                                    simple to set up and can serve as a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)">Samba</a>,

                                    Are you a programmer? Then you might want to try out <b>code-server</b>! It is a web-based implementation
                                    of <b>Visual Studio Code</b> and runs off of a computer, either locally or on the interwebs! You can choose
                                    to run this on an old computer, so you can code from your tablet, phone and computer while being
                                    fully synced up!

                                    Instead of running a full operating system designed for hosting files (like OpenMediaVault), you can set up a SMB (samba)
                                    or NFS (network file system) server on <b>almost any Linux computer</b> (Ubuntu suggested)!

                            <p>
                                Have you been using a computer for the last 10 years but never bothered to clean it out? Now might
                                be the time. Now, it is important to know that you might break your computer doing this if you do
                                not do it properly. Cleaning out the computer will allow the fans to access airways that were
                                previously clogged with dust and gross stuff, and a reapplication of thermal paste for better
                                thermal conductivity can be the difference between your computer being a jet engine and a quiet
                                mouse.

                                    <h3>1. Opening the computer</h3>
                                    <b>Google</b> your computer model's teardown tutorials. You would want to get as deep into the computer as you
                                    can <b>without doing unnecessary things</b>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3>2. Clean It</h3>
                                    Inside, you want to <b>vacuum</b> out all the dust and clean out the inside.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3>3. Find the Heatsink</h3>
                                    Then, you want to <b>locate the heatsink</b> (a metal plate, perhaps with fans next to it)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3>4. Re-paste the Computer</h3>
                                    Get some <b>thermal paste</b>, and open the heatsink. When the heatsink is open, remove the old
                                    thermal paste with <b>isopropyl alcohol + cotton swab</b> and apply a pea-sized drop of thermal paste on to
                                    the CPU and/or GPU. Again, this is <b>not a tutorial</b>, rather for reference and a database of things
                                    you should do.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3>5. Reassemble the Computer</h3>
                                    Put the <b>heatsink back on</b>, remembering to follow the numbers on the screws to apply even pressure
                                    to the heatsink so the thermal paste does not get squashed down on one side or another. You want the
                                    heatsink's pressure to <b>evenly</b> spread the thermal paste out onto the entire surface of the
                                    processor. This may be scary at first, but after doing it a few times <b>(have confidence in yourself!)</b>,
                                    you will get very comfortable with applying thermal paste! <b>Then, just reassemble the computer!</b>
                                </li>
