                    <p>You've come to learn how to "hack". You'll probably be sad to find that there is not a secret to
                        breaking into
                        someone else's laptop or
                        anything of that general vicinity. First, it's illegal except with explicit permission and it's
                        rather
                        difficult and tedious, especially for
                        anyone who isn't a "hacker" already.


                        DISCLAIMER: This is for educational purposes ONLY. I take NO responsibilities of your actions.
                        (Sorry if I sound
                        rude, just had to get that out of the way.)

                    <p>Onwards!</p>

                    <p>If you have seen any "hacker" in any movie ever, the screen is flashing with 0s and 1s, windows
                        are popping up all
                        the time, the green text is unreadable to the untrained.
                        It might look something like this:

                    <p class="photocaption">Terminal running powermetrics, an advanced computer monitoring program.</p>
                    <p>Movies actually get this right. Terminal is something every hacker uses. Though it may seem
                        scary, it's actually
                        very simple.
                        Simple in the sense its easy to use, and simple in the sense it can easily break your computer.
                        Here are a few
                        interesting (albiet scary) commands!
                    </p>
                    <p>1. sudo rm -rf /</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">sudo rm -rf /</code></pre>
                    <p>The command "sudo rm -rf /" is an infamous command that erases EVERYTHING in a computer. It is
                        very powerful.

                        Perhaps we should take a more detailed look into what this does.


                        "sudo" is a prefix that is put in front of
                        any command that needs or should have superuser access. "Superuser" provides system administrator
                        level access.


                        "rm" is used to delete files. In this case, it is deleting everything. The reason it is deleting
                        everything
                        is because / is the main directory, and all files branch off "/". In the middle,


                        "-rf" are the options.

                        "r" is an option to delete everything under the directory and all sub-directories after.

                        "f" is an option
                        to force delete files. It will override many protections. However, it will not override
                        write-protected
                        directories.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. :(){ :|:& };:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">:(){ :|:& };:</code></pre>
                    <p>This command is called a fork bomb. After running it, it continually uses up system resources,
                        causing the system
                        is slowed
                        or to crash. This command is harder to explain than sudo rm -rf /, so I'll skip explaining this
                        one. In simple
                        terms, it replicates itself until
                        the system is filled with the bomb.
                    </p>
                    <p>DDoS Attacks</p>
                    <p>DDoS attacks, also known as Distributed Denial of Service attacks are common and easy to execute.
                        A DDoS attack is simply an attack to deny something of service. It is most commonly used on
                        servers and
                        websites.
                        In a DDoS attack, the attacker continually "pings" the website until the website gets so many
                        "pings" that it
                        gets either overwhelmed or confused. A ping is a request to the website. It is commonly used to
                        check if a
                        website
                        is up and working. However, a hacker can take advantage of it and flood the server with
                        requests, ultimately
                        breaking the server.

                        Another type of DDoS attack is a ping that sends massive amounts of data. The data is too much
                        for the server to
                        handle at once and the server crashes. This type of DDoS attack is not common today as almost
                        every single
                        server
                        has some type of guard to prevent such attacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>Person-in-the-Middle Attack</p>
                    <p>A person-in-the-middle attack (I'll call it PITM for short) is where a hacker intercepts a user's
                        connection
                        to someplace. For example, Alex and Jack are talking to each other online.
                        <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">Alex -> Jack</code></pre>
                        <p>However, Alex and Jack don't know anything about online safety and decide to talk
                            over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). This means the data they send is not encrypted.
                            <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">Data (Non-Encrypted) -> (Non-encrypted) Data</code></pre>
                            <p>Suddenly, a hacker decides to squeeze himself/herself into the conversation. The
                                conversation has now
                                become:
                                <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">Alex -> Hacker -> Jack</code></pre>
                                <p>With this, neither Alex nor Jack knows that every single thing they send to each
                                    other is being
                                    monitored and collected
                                    by the hacker. Scary, right?
                                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">Alex (Sends: Hi, Jack!) -> Hacker (Relays: Hi, Jack!) -> Jack (Receives: Hi, Jack!)</code></pre>
                                    <p>However, the hacker can now easily alter the texts Alex sends to Jack or vice
                                        versa.
                                        <pre>
                        <code class="language-bash">Alex (Sends: Good Morning!) -> Hacker (Alters: Bad Morning!) -> Jack (Receives: Bad Morning!)</code></pre>
                                        <p>PITM attacks are much more difficult to accomplish on HTTPS (Hypertext
                                            Transfer Protocol
                                            Secure), where the data sent
                                            is all encrypted. The moral of the story is to use HTTPS to keep yourself
                                            safe online. The
                                            good thing is that almost every single
                                            trusted website is using HTTPS, including this website!</p>
