                    <p>Gaming laptops. Such great hardware, so portable, right? Well, not really. There's not much
                        difference between a
                        ‚Äúgaming laptop‚Äù and a ‚Äúnormal laptop‚Äù. I have a gaming laptop, but it's an actually just an
                        ultrabook with a GTX
                        1650 Max-Q. The Razer Blade Stealth is a great computer, lightweight and compact coming in at
                        just about the size of
                        a MacBook Pro 13 inch, and a bit heavier. The build is amazing. There is no body flex or deck
                        flex. The body is made
                        out of anodized aluminum. Other than the fact the it's a fingerprint magnet, it's great.
                        However, this is because
                        Razer actually has the ability to manufacture such a product. Many companies advertise their
                        ‚Äúgaming laptops‚Äù as
                        super fast and best graphics in the world. Yes. It is true. However, they never tell you about
                        the dark side of
                        getting a ‚Äúgaming laptop‚Äù. Sure, it runs Fortnite at 120 FPS on high settings. But it weights
                        heavier than a block
                        of lead. Not to mention how thick the computer gets. My Razer Blade, you might say, is just
                        around the same as a
                        MacBook Pro 13 inch. That's because it has only an i7-1065G7 and a GTX 1650 Max-Q. I can get
                        around 8 hours of light
                        use. But that's because the CPU and GPU are low power consumption mobile parts. There isn't a
                        whole RTX 2080 Ti and
                        a AMD Threadripper in there. It runs Fortnite at 90 FPS on medium. That is the tradeoff between
                        portability and
                        performance. It is necessary (hopefully Apple Silicon can break that chain) for the manufacturer
                        to choose whether
                        to prioritize performance or portability.</p>
                    <p>Honestly, don't go for ‚Äúgaming laptops‚Äù just because they are marketed as gaming. Look into CPU
                        specs and GPU specs.
                        Learn lots about laptops and desktops. I did not choose my Razer Blade because it is a ‚Äúgaming
                        laptop‚Äù from a
                        ‚Äúgaming company‚Äù (I did choose it because, you know, Razer). I chose it for its portability to
                        performance ratio and
                        its reputation for high build quality. I could have chosen a 15" Blade, but I never really liked
                        15" computers. If
                        you want high performance, go for 17"+. If you want portability, go for 13" or less. I'm not
                        saying that 15"
                        laptops are horrid by any means. I just feel that it is like the middle seat on an airplane
                        (however you want to
                        take that statement).</p>
                    <p>So, what do you do if you DON'T want a ‚Äúgaming laptop‚Äù? Well, if you don't care about the
                        marketing, there's whole
                        galaxies of selections to choose from. For example, a Dell XPS 13 with an eGPU would do great.
                        You get the battery
                        life when you need it, and get the performance (extra oomph) when you need that. Cool, right?
                        Yeah. I thought so. I
                        have never had an eGPU, or build a PC (I have built my own phone). This is all views from tech
                        YouTubers like LTT,
                        MKBHD and Austin Evans. Like with every mature market (quote MKBHD), there's a ‚Äúgo to‚Äù product.
                        For eGPUS, that
                        would the Razer's offerings. They are priced well and is very compact/compatible.</p>
                    <p>I have talked a lot about the bad sides of getting a ‚Äúgaming computer‚Äù, but let's talk about the
                        good side. Most
                        gaming laptops have TONS of robust cooling to keep the laptop from thermal throttling.
                        Manufacturers also throw in
                        the best parts they can find with expensive systems. A couple even have full on RTX 2080s. These
                        result in
                        best-in-class performance. An example of this would the the ROG Zephyrus G14. Ryzen 9 4000
                        series means probably the
                        best performance ever in a laptop in general. In LTT's video, it even out ran the ludicrously
                        large Acer Predator
                        with an Intel i9 chip.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, gaming laptops, like everything else in tech, is worth it if you know your parts
                        and you know what you
                        are looking for.</p>
                    <p>P.S. Please don't game with a MacBook. Please.</p>
