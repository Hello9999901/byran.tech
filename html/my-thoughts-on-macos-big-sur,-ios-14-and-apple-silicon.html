                    <p>macOS Big Sur, iOS 14, Apple Silicon. To me, I would say that Apple Silicon was the biggest announcement of WWDC
                        2020. It was a huge leap for apple to finally move on from Intel chips. Many people don‚Äôt realize it, but Intel
                        makes some of the worst chips for MacBooks. Yes, they make real fast chips with amazing single-threaded
                        performance, but the chips Apple chooses are simply illogical. My 2017 MacBook has a dual-core (yes, 2 cores)
                        i5. To Intel‚Äôs credit though, it does stay cool (kinda) and is still quite useable to this day (or is that
                        Apple‚Äôs credit?) I am really looking forward to the new Apple Silicon-based laptops and hopefully desktops. If
                        Apple‚Äôs WWDC is to be believed, their chips will run at desktop speeds whilst consuming laptop-grade power. They
                        are confident enough to say this because the iPad Pro 2020, with their A12Z processors are indeed faster than
                        many, many laptops out there. As a representation, it runs Fortnite at 120 FPS. To the gamers out there, that‚Äôs
                        120Hz refresh rate display on an iPad. That‚Äôs faster than a PS4 or Xbox can run. Desktop processors can be even
                        more impressive. They would be on a whole new level. Apple Silicon, which uses ARM architecture is amazing great
                        at giving high performance at low power/wattage. This means that, theoretically, you can get Core-i9 performance
                        whilst consuming less than 150 watts (this is just me, I don‚Äôt have anything to back it up with).</p>
                    <p>macOS Big Sur - another island off the coast of California, just like Catalina Island. (I just realized that when
                        you type ‚ÄúBig Sur‚Äù, the Sur is highlighted as an incorrectly spelled word) It looks, quite frankly, like iPadOS.
                        In Apple‚Äôs defense, they are pushing for continuity in their products and OS, so it is only a matter of time
                        before they overhaul their desktop OS. macOS Big Sur has its goods and bads, just like everything else. It will
                        have a fresh new UI, newly update Xcode and Safari, and much more. However, I really have an aversion for their
                        new symbols. I like them in iPadOS and iOS, but not in desktop OSes. It just feels too ‚Äúmobile-like‚Äù. But hey,
                        new chip, new UI, new OS. Huge year for Apple‚Äôs desktop products compared to last year. Also, Apple finally got
                        rid of the 10.XX.XX numbering, deciding to go from 10.XX.XX to 11.XX.XX (after around 2 decades in 10.XX.XX).
                    </p>
                    <p>iOS 14. I mean, I don‚Äôt use a phone in daily use, and I really don‚Äôt care what OS I use. Android and iOS are both
                        fine, but I do prefer iOS. They haven‚Äôt overhauled the design or the OS, just some cool stuff that, as EVERYBODY
                        has pointed out, has been on Android since forever. Widgets, app list, just to name a few. Unlock your car with
                        your iPhone, and ‚Äúhalf-apps‚Äù so you can do stuff in an app without downloading it. Cool stuff.</p>
                    <p>There wasn‚Äôt much for iPad OS either. Nothing much I really deem important, as I just use my iPad as my gaming
                        ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù and ‚Äúphone‚Äù. You can go watch the WWDC 2020 recaps and get your own info.</p>
                    <p>P.S. AMD is still better than Intel in most applications</p>
